  About:
    rbtorstat is a simple web page generator, written in Ruby, which shows status information about the rTorrent bittorrent client. This makes it possible to quickly have an overview of your torrent list from a remote location, without having to log into the remote machine that actually runs rTorrent.

  Operating System:
    - Linux

  Requirements:
    - Ruby (http://ruby-lang.org)
    - bencode (http://rubyforge.org/projects/bencode/)
    - rTorrent (http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/)

  rTorrent Configuration:
    rbtorstat needs to read the torrent session data, so rTorrent needs to be configured to save this information to a pre-defined directory. The following shows all the session-data specific configuration rTorrent (.rtorrent.rc) options:
      # Sets the directory where session data files are stored
      session = /opt/bittorrent/sessiondata
      # Keeps session data files even if torrent has finished
      session_on_completion = yes
      # Not really required, but recommended - see rtorrent(1) man page
      session_lock = yes
      # Save session data every 5 mins, with a 4 min offset
      schedule = session_save,240,300,session_save=

  Usage:
    $ ruby rbtorstat.rb > index.html

  Cron job:
    */5 * * * *   root ruby /path/to/rbtorstat.rm /opt/bittorrent/sessiondata/ > /var/www/index.html
